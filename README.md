Introduction
============
Adapted original code to work on the A500 mini.

Copy the **a500mini-2usb-converter** folder to your **sketchbook** folder.

Copy the **Custom Boards** folder to your arduino ide **hardware** folder and select **A500 Mini Pro Micro ATmega32u4 (5v, 16mhz)** from the boards menu.

I've included a modified case top stl that includes space for 6 buttons (X, Y, L, R, Menu, Home)

This adaptation assumes your joystick has 2 separate buttons wired to button 1 and 2 (pins 6 and 9 on the DE9 (DB9)).

It also assumes you're using an arduino pro micro (clone or otherwise) and arduino ide 1.8.13, although the version shouldn't really matter too much i don't think.
